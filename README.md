In this big car rental application you are tasked to develop an API which calculates the total expense for a given trip. Do not use any property file to store the values mentioned above. Instead think in terms of injectable interfaces to provide the information assuming members of your team will be responsible to develop the same. You develop a default implementation for the same where data is hard coded. Actual implementation of those may pull data from database, file or http service.
